<h2>A side note</h2>
<p>These are just my opinions, please do not come after me.</p>
<p>(As a side note, I'm sorry I couldn't make this about Sam.)</p>
<p>(Don't get me wrong, I appreciate Sam's physical attributes, such as his impeccable jawine, his perfect hair and prepossesing glasses. Of course, we can't forget about his astonishing mental capabilities, of which there are too many to name.)</p>
<p>(I just felt like creating a mere website would be like spitting in the face of Samuel Wang's heavenly image.)</p>
<p>(A puny mortal like me could not confine the divine grace of Sam to a meagre interface on a computer screen.)</p>
<p>(In fact, da Vinci, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Gogh, Picasso and the rest of the greatest painters that have ever lived combined could not even come close to painting an image of Sam. It would be like trying to paint the perfect human.)</p>
<p>(I hope you understand where I'm coming from, and why I had to make this website about an earthly subject and not one of divine porportions.)</p>
