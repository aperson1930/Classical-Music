<h2>My favourite piece from this era</h2>
<p>This period should actually not be defined by just "Impressionistic", as this period actually includes Post-romantic, Neoclassical, Minimalist, Early 20th century, and much more. However, this period is most famous for Impressionism, so I decided to name it just that.</p>
<p>The impressionist movement was lead by Debussy, who, although adherently denying the title, captured the Impressionistic style perfectly, using advanced pedal techniques to create some dreamy layers of sound that linger in the air. Ravel, also an important Impressionistic and Neoclassical composer, balanced artistry and technique to create arguably the most challenging pieces to play on the piano, complete with virtuostic passages and transcendal melodies and harmonies. Opposing Impressionism was Satie, the leader of the Minimalist style, creating simple yet enchanting pieces, while Sibelius hung onto the expression of the Romantic period with his soaring symphonies and splashes of Finnish nationalism</p>
<p>Some people dislike music from this period, as it includes many strange chords and unresolving dissonances, but I personnaly think that these, murky, unresolved, chords and passages, evoke feelings of longing and hope.</p>
<p>My favourite composer from this era is probably Debussy. I'm a little biased from this one as I haven't listened to much Ravel (his piano suites last around 30 minutes), or any of the other famous composers. The piece I like the most from Debussy is his Arabesque No. 1. This piece has a special place in my heart as I won gold in a piano festival with it.</p>
<p>It begins with these shimmering progression of broken chords, which evolves into a moving and beautiful melody. The entire piece is filled with these unconventional chords, such as V9 and V13, that, with the help of some skillful pedalling, casts a shining light over the piece like a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day.</p>
