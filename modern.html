<h2>My favourite piece from this era</h2>
<p>Finally, we have the contemporary era. Compositions in this era range from jazz standards to Taylor Swift hits, and there are too many contrasting and unique composers to name. Some composers that stick out to me are Shostakovich, protesting against the USSR in the form of powerful symphonies. Prokofiev, the polar opposite of Shostakovich, openly embraced the USSR, with many of his pieces being commissions from the Soviets, making emotionally deep compositions of almost every type. Stravinsky made innovations in rhythm in his tense and energy-packed ballets.</p>
<p>Contemporary music is probably my least favourite era due to it's dissonance and arhythmical compositions that a monkey brain like mine can't understand. However, <p>I find Shostakovich's music to be the most impactful, as he was silenced and threatened by Soviet authorities when he tried to express himself in his music, leading him to live a life of constant fear and anger, dying a broken man. His mental breakdown is also very evident in his music, especially if you listen to his later String Quartets.</p>
<p>I would choose Shostakovich's Waltz No. 2, but that piece was probably the least Shostakovich-esque piece he had ever composed, so instead I'll choose his 8th String Quartet.</p>
<p>An interesting thing about this piece is that it includes many reiterations of the "Shostakovich" or "DSCH" motif. This motif, consisting of D, E-flat, C and B, when pronounced in German, spells out D. Sch, which is short for Dimitri Shostakovich.</p>
<p>I like this piece, not because of the melody or the music, but because of the musical expression in it. Shostakovich was going through a terrible mental crisis, and he wrote down all his deepest and darkest emotions onto sheet music perfectly, evoking feelings of tragedy and human agony.</p>
<p>It begins with the four instruments dragging out the DSCH motif, filling the atmosphere with a sense of terror and dread. This cumulates up to the second movement, where it erupts with a frantic frenzy of notes that are enough to give one anxiety for weeks. The third movement is in the style of a waltz, and is accented with sharp pizzicatos, but the melody is still plagued with a sense of unease, moving from one dissonant interval to the next. The fourth movement contrasts from fortississimo to piannissimo from bar to bar, leaving you unprepared for what will come next. It also has a quotation from a revolutionnary song from the days of the Russian revolution, as if he was spitting in the face of Stalin and his regime. Finally, the fifth movement imitates a fugue, tossing the melody around from instrument to instrument as it slowly builds up to a final forte, before dissolving into melancholy. This string quartet is truly an experience.
