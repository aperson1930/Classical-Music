<h2>My favourite piece from this era</h2>
<p>We've finally made it to the long-awaited Romantic period, a period characterized by the most beautiful of melodies and the most daunting passages. This period was hugely different from the strict rules of Baroque and Classical, using techiniques such as tempo rubato, warping the rhythm according to the pianist's emotions.</p>
<p>Chopin practically defined this era, his deepest emotions translated perfectly on the keyboard in his Nocturnes, Ballades, Preludes, and many more. Liszt composed some of the most technically challenging passages that pianists still struggle to play today in his Etudes, Piano Concertos and Fantasies. Tchaikovsky reminisced about the former grace of the Classical period in his ballets and chamber music, while Puccinni and Verdi perfected the art of the opera, creating some of the most moving stories to this date. Brahms blended romanticism with tradition in his dramatic and lush symphonies and piano works. Finally, Rachmaninoff following in Liszt's footsteps to create even more virtuostic pieces, stretching the performer to the sole limits of their ability.<p>
<p>As you can tell, the Romantic period was filled with many famous composers that all deserve to have their piece portrayed in the no. 1 spot and it was harder to choose the composer than the piece. However, I eventually decided on Chopin.</p>
<p>Chopin's music is always emotional and heartfelt, letting the performer pour their heart out on the piano. His pieces are also filled with a dash of Polish patriotism, as shown by his extensive Polonaises and Mazurkas. Despite his impressive repertoire, my favourite Chopin piece has to be his Ballade No. 1 in G minor.</p>
<p>10 minutes in length, this piece is more of an epic poem than a piano piece. This piece can be related to the story of a soldier, beginning with hope and a dance-like pattern where he dances with his partner before heading off to war. It develops into this beautiful middle section where the soldier admires the peaceful world around him, but with the dark undertone of a storm brewing. The dance section returns, where he has one final memory of the dance with his partner before the coda, where the horrors and terrors of war break out in a rapid dramatic section of scales and chords. It ends in a powerful octave section and a cold tonic note as the soldier realizes all hope is lost and that he will never return home.</p>
