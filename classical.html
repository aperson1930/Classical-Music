<h2>My favourite piece from this era</h2>
<p>The classical period was a period of grace and elegance in music, containing Mozart's refined piano sonatas and concertos, Haydn's 100+ symphonies and his quartets, and Rossini's heart-wrenching operas.</p>
<p>In this list, I will be including the early works of Beethoven, as he was more of a transitionary figure between Classical and Romantic than a defined Classical or Romantic period composer.</p>
<p>Choosing this piece was relatively easy, as it was just a matter of choosing my favourite Mozart piece. The modern perception of Mozart's music are lullabies played for babies, but when you analyze the contents of Mozart, you can truly find unmatched genius in his style of music. Unlike Bach, his music is relatively simple, but yet graceful and expressive.</p>
<p>There is a saying in the musical world that Mozart is "too easy for children and too difficult for artists". This is because, for children, the notes are simple and easy to play, but it is an astonishing act to play Mozart well as a performer. The melodies is exposed through its "simplicity" allowing for no murkiness of the pedal to hide behind. Every note must be expressed perfectly and without bumps, while following the elegant rhetorical structure of his melodies.</p>
<p>You must hold back your Chopin-esque rubatos and your foggy dreamscapes reminicient of Debussy, and still play with beautiful expression that can move people to tears.</p>
<p>Truly, Mozart's music is harder to play than Rachmaninoff or Liszt or the works of any other piano virtuoso.</p>
<p>That being said, my favourite Mozart piece is not one of his piano sonatas, but instead his Violin Concerto No. 5 in A major. This piece is filled with joy and playfulness.</p>
<p>The violin solo is bright and cheerful, and it is a piece that can make your day.</p>
