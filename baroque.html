<h2>My favourite piece from this era</h2>
<p>The Baroque era was filled with amazingly complex music, which were all governed by sets of rules and laws that you had to follow. Baroque music is structured, and yet some of the most complex pieces in the world came out of this era, such as Bach's mastery of polytonality in his fugues and inventions, Handel's glorious choruses and Vivaldi's descriptive and suspense-building concertos.</p>
<p>In terms of sheer complexity and talent, I would definitely choose Bach's Goldberg variations, this piece containing some of the most amazing musical genius in all history.
<p>However, in terms of enjoyment (the Goldberg variations are about 45 minutes in length), I would choose Bach's chorale "Come sweet death." Despite the dramatic name, this piece is incredibly beautiful and moving. There are many arrangemnts of this piece, and I personnaly prefer the arrangement for choir, as it really brings out all the beauty in this piece.</p>
<p>The melody of this piece depicts sorrow, lament and suffering, but also a glimmer of hope for the "blessed rest" to come to them. This piece is truly nothing short of heart-breaking.</p>
